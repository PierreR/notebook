== RUN PUPPET

Watch out ! The first puppet run is not the same ! Puppet will auto-sign and auto-wired with the Puppet Master. You need to pass the environment the first time. In Puppet, the environment is not a fact !


== Role, Profile, Module

A role is an entity that can work out in perfect isolation when hosted in a machine.

You might say that the role "scm" is made of 2 profiles: nginx and stash with an adhoc configuration.

Ok that's nice and shiny but why do we need profile at all ...

Well profile starts to make sense if you start to re-use them for instance within multiple role ...

SCM -> Stash and Nginx

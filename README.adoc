This personal notebook is meant to be used as a private note/reminder.

As a bonus it might help others ;-)

## Convert in html or pdf

You will need to install https://nixos.org/nix/download.html[nix] to generate the html or pdf.

```
make html
make pdf
```

NOTE: To get `syntax highlighting` with pygments, you need https://github.com/PierreR/devhome/blob/dda32311f395c1cfe5c9247985574c9abb108926/.nixpkgs/config.nix[to override the nix `asciidoctor` package.]

# Intero setup

Setting up a working Intero/Spacemacs environment is not that easy. The following method does not use a `.dev/dev-ghc-env` file.
Install Stack::

`Intero` requires `stack`. Install it `system wide` (in `/etc/nixos/local-configuration.nix`)

Current used version is `1.6.5 x86_64` as defined by the nixpkgs stable 18.03 channel.

Build with Stack::
+
.$HOME/.dev/stack.yaml
```
resolver: lts-11.17
nix:
  enable: true
  packages:
    - zlib.dev
    - gcc
    - ruby
    - pkgconfig

system-ghc: true
skip-ghc-check: true

```
Stack downloads all the haskell libs but it seems to do so in a global user space (?) `stack clean` or `removing $PROJECT/.stack-work` won't erase them.

Install intero::

Even if you install `Intero` in user space with `stack install intero` inside a nix shell
(`nix-shell -p gcc 'haskellPackages.ghcWithPackages(p: with p; [syb ghc-paths mtl network random])'`)
it would not be recognize within `Spacemacs`.
+
This is true with `Intero 0.1.32`.
+
The only way seems to let `emacs` install `intero` the first time. This will work only if `ghc`, `binutils` and `gcc` are on the `$PATH`.
You will need to add those to `local-configuration.nix`.
+
The installation will work but it won't find intero because it believe it is in `x86_64-linux-nix` folder that does not exist.
The easy fix is to add a symlink: `cd $HOME/.stack/compiler-tools; ln -s x86_64-linux x86_64-linux-nix`.

= Cluster

== Consul

== Swarm node

Each node is configured by puppet and contain:

- a container swarm running inside a docker (spawn with the docker engine daemon)
- a docker registrator running inside a docker (spawn with the docker engine daemon)
- a consult agent (doesn't run within a docker)

== DNS

Consul is used as a DNS service. `dnsmask` is configured within each swarm node while every dockers inside a node is running with `--dns 172.17.0.1`.footnote:[the DNS host for every docker is always 172.17.0.1]

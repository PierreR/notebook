# Git

## Internals

Git maintained snapshot of directory's contents. It is a content-addressable filesystem, a simple key value data store. Keys are SHA-1 hash and values are objects.

There are 4 different types of objects:

  - Blob stores files (it does not store the name of the file)
  - Tree references other trees and/or blobs, stores the file name and groups them together (as directories do)
  - Commit points to a single tree and realize "snapshots".
  - Tag marks a specific commit

## Tips

* Ignore files in all projects but keep this for yourself

	. Add to your ~/.gitconfig file

	```
	[core]
	excludesfile = /home/username/.gitignore
	```

	. Create a ~/.gitignore file with file patterns to be ignored

definition::

A category is a bunch of objects together with `morphisms` footnote:[also called arrows].
The objects have not structure or meaning, actually they only serve to mark the beginning or end of an arrow.
Morphisms are direct mappings between these objects footnote:[you can have zero, one or many arrows from one object to another] that preverse a `structure`.
The structure whatever it is characterizes the category.

* there must exist a morphism called `identity` (the zero) that maps an object into itself (e.g: 1A).
* the morphisms need to compose while respecting `associativity`: +
  `h∘(g∘f) == (h∘g)∘f`

.Example:
In a functional programming language, morphisms/arrows are `functions` and objects are `types`.

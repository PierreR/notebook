= Glossary

Control plane::
Kubernetes master cluster that includes the kube `apiserver`, `scheduler` and `controller managers`.
Usually the `etcd` cluster is part of it too (but it can be separated).

Deployments::
Collection of resources and references

DaemonSet::
Ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod.

Secrets::
- Separate sensible information and flag them as such.
- Don't provide encryption (Base64 encoded).
- Set of key/value pairs

Namespaces::
Create multiple virtual clusters on the same physical clusters.
You can limit resources such as CPU per namespace.

Container Network Interface (CNI)::
ex: `flannel`

Container-Native Storage (CNS)::

IPVS::
IP Virtual Server is built on top of the Netfilter and implements transport-layer load balancing as part of the Linux kernel.
It can now be use instead of iptables to scale `kube-proxy` (services L4).

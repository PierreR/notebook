= ACI integration

The ACI CNI Plugin for OCP provides integration between the APIC and one or more OpenShift cluster.

The plugin connects all pods to the integrated VXLAN overlay provided by Cisco.
It models the cluster as a Virtual Machine Manager (`VMM`) Domain  (one per OCP cluster) on the Cisco APIC.

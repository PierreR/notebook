== Architecture

An  service mesh is logically split into a #data plane# and a #control plane#:

- The data plane is composed of a set of intelligent proxies (Envoy) deployed as sidecars. These proxies mediate and control all network communication between microservices. They also collect and report telemetry on all mesh traffic.

- The control plane manages and configures the proxies to route traffic.

ORMs are mixing different concerns. There were introduced by OO zealots to avoid the declarative nature of SQL. Now according to Martin Fowler they are just a way to get memory cache. Yes right but that is not the way ORMs have been sold ?

The whole ORM story looks like a complete disaster. Building a graph of objects in memory across sessions has proven to make little sense in many projects I had worked on.

If you deal with a relational database, abstracting it with mutable pojos is dubious at best. I am pretty convinced a nice API query interface such as LINQ can solve the problems of the myriads of SQL statements to handle.

Here is the problem, at the end, data are used to be feed into viewer. So let's get this straight. Output JSON directly from a query language interface !

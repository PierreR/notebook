# Logstash

The main role of Logsatsh is to transform (in a centralized place) a stream of data  before it is indexed in EL.
For some data input such as SQL database it is the only official "supported" way to get the data into EL.

Logstash pulls data from one or more sources before pushing them downstream.
It can be used to consume a Kafka queue.

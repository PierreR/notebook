# Apache Kafka

Kafka is a distributed streaming platform.
It deals with publisher-consumer and queue semantics by grouping data into topics.

## Use cases

- Event spikes
- Elasticsearch not reachable

You don't necessary need Kafka if you can tolerate a relaxed search latency.
If your application is emitting more logs than Logstash/Elasticsearch can ingest at real time, logs can be rotated and ships by `Filebeat`.
In that your local filesystem will become the temporary buffer.

## Topics

Topics are logical grouping of messages. They provide a way to isolate data from other consumers if necessary.
For logging and event driven data, you might group multiple users in one topic based on attributes like data volume and expected search latency.

A good analogy is an expressway â€” you mostly want the fast lane to be free flowing, so slower vehicles are expected to move to other lanes.
Think of Kafka topics as lanes and events as cars!

Topics can be created on the fly when data is first published to a non-existent one.

## Logstash
.logstash config
```
kafka {
   zk_connect => "hostname:port"
   topic_id => "apache_logs"
   ...
}
```

Another reason to use multiple Logstash instances is to add fault tolerance.

## Partitions

The partition count controls how many logs the topic will be sharded into.
First each partition must fit entirely on a single server.
The more partitions you have, the more throughput you get when consuming data.

## ZooKeeper

Kafka has a dependency on Apache ZooKeeper.

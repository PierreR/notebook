### Proxy

Pipes defines a single type `Proxy` which is a monad transformer:

....
 (Proxy p) => p a' a b' b m r

  Upstream | Downstream
     +---------+
     |         |
 a' <==       <== b'
     |  Proxy  |
 a  ==>   m   ==> b
     |         |
     +----|----+
          r
....
```
type Effect = Proxy X () () X
runEffect :: (Monad m) => Effect m r -> m r
```

Effect is a proxy that never yield or wait.
The default API exposes a pull-based unidirectional flow.

### Producer

A Producer is a monad transformer that extends any base monad with a yield command. `yield` emits a value, suspending the current Producer until the value is consumed. If nobody consumes the value (which is possible) then yield never returns.

....
type Producer b m r = Proxy X () () b m r
     +---------+
     |         |
Void <==       <== ()
     |  Proxy  |
 ()  ==>       ==> b
     |         |
     +---------+
....

```haskell
yield :: (Monad m) => b -> Producer' b m ()

for :: (Monad m)
    =>       Proxy x' x b' b m a'
    -> (b -> Proxy x' x c' c m b')
    ->       Proxy x' x c' c m a'


-- "into" compose the bodies of `for`
(~>) :: (Monad m)
     => (a -> Producer b m r)
     -> (b -> Producer c m r)
     -> (a -> Producer c m r)
(f ~> g) x = for (f x) g

```

TIP: `~>` and yield form a Category ("Generator") where `yield` is the identity.

With `for` you consume every element of a `Producer` the exact same way. If this is not suitable, use `next` or a `Consumer`.

Think of `next` as pattern matching on the head of the Producer. This Either returns a Left if the Producer is done or it returns a Right containing the next value, a, along with the remainder of the Producer:

```
next :: Monad m => Producer a m r -> m (Either r (a, Producer a m r))
```

### Consumer

A consumer represents an "exhaustible" (it may refuse to accept new values) and possibly effectful sink of values. An example of an exhaustible sink is `toOutput` from `pipes-concurrency`, which will terminate if the `Output` it writes to has been sealed.

`await` blocks waiting for a new value. If nobody provides it (which is possible) then await never returns.

....
type Consumer a = Proxy () a () X
     +---------+
     |         |
 () <==       <== ()
     |  Proxy  |
 a  ==>       ==> Void
     |         |
     +---------+
....

```
await :: Monad m => Consumer' a m a
```
.(>~)
Repeatedly feeds `await` in the consumer with the action passed as the first parameter.
This allows consumer composition

.Examples
```haskell
runEffect $ lift getLine >~ stdoutLn
```
....
        +- Feed             +- Consumer to      +- Returns new
        |  action           |  feed             |  Effect
        v                   v                   v
....

```
(>~) :: Effect m b       -> Consumer b m c   -> Effect m c
(>~) :: Consumer a m b   -> Consumer b m c   -> Consumer a m c
(>~) :: Producer y m b   -> Pipe     b y m c -> Producer   y m c
(>~) :: Pipe     a y m b -> Pipe     b y m c -> Pipe     a y m c
```

TIP: `(>~)` and `await` form a Category  where `await` is the identity.


### Pipe

....
type Pipe a b = Proxy () a () b
     +---------+
     |         |
 () <==       <== ()
     |  Proxy  |
 a  ==>       ==> b
     |         |
     +---------+
....

```
(>->) :: Monad m => Producer a m r -> Consumer a m r -> Effect m r
(>->) :: Monad m => Producer a m r -> Pipe   a b m r -> Producer b m r
(>->) :: Monad m => Pipe   a b m r -> Consumer b m r -> Consumer a m r
(>->) :: Monad m => Pipe   a b m r -> Pipe   b c m r -> Pipe   a c m r

cat :: (Monad m) => Pipe a a m r
cat = forever $ do
    x <- await
    yield x
```
TIP: `(>->)` and `cat` form a Category where `cat` is the identity.


### Bidirectional API

.The response category
```haskell
yield = respond
for = (//>)
(~>) = (/>/)
```

.The reply category
```haskell
await = request ()
```

## Lift

.StateP
Run `StateT` in the base monad of the Proxy passed as a second argument.
```haskell
runStateP
    :: (Monad m)
    => s -- state (usually of type proxy)
    -> Proxy a' a b' b (S.StateT s m) r
    -> Proxy a' a b' b m (r, s)
```

.Example
```
-- !! this return a Producer a m (Maybe r, Producer a m r) !!
-- This makes sense you are actually running the StateT monad from Producer a (StateT (Producer a m r) m r) r
-- r is either Just which means the original Producer is empty or Nothing which mean you should go on drawing from the original Producer
-- The top producer accumulates your split, then you have a pair of a Maybe r and your original Producer

runStateP p $ do -- p will be used to feed the underlying proxy
    -- entering a monad of the form: (Proxy (<- StateT monad <- Proxy))
    -- All computation happens inside the underlying monad that is initially fed up by the param p
    x <- lift draw -- lift the next value of the underlying proxy
    case x of -- Left if the underlying proxy is empty or Right with the drawn element
        Left  r -> return (Just r)
        Right a -> do
            yield a -- push `a onto the top proxy
            (Just <$> input) >-> (Nothing <$ takeWhile (== a))  -- start streaming values from the underlying proxy
                                                                --
```

## Concurrent API

You have got a mailbox !

```
(output, input) <- spawn Unbounded
```

....
producer >-> (consumer) output >...> input (producer) >-> consumer
....
Send to the mailbox using `toOutput output` (output is able to sent mail). So `toOutput` transforms the output into a consumer.
Read from the mailbox using `fromInput input` (input is able to receive mail). So `fromInput` transforms the input into a producer.

```
newtype Input a = Input { recv :: S.STM (Maybe a) }
```


## Pipes-Handle

Pipes-handle models the input/output stream analogy. An output stream accepts bytes (you write into it) whereas you read from an inputstream. The proxy that can "read from" in the pipes ecosystem is the consumer.
By analogy, an output stream accepts output bytes and sends them to some sink. So you write into an output stream.

## Pipes-Parse

.Parser
Parser is like Consumers but with the ability to keep the leftover

```haskell
type Parser a m r = forall x . StateT (Producer a m x) m r

draw :: (Monad m) => Parser a m (Maybe a)

runStateT  :: Parser a m r -> Producer a m x -> m (r, Producer a m x)
evalStateT :: Parser a m r -> Producer a m x -> m  r
execStateT :: Parser a m r -> Producer a m x -> m (   Producer a m x)
```

.Lenses
Lenses served as transformation in both directions.
```haskell
splitAt
    :: Monad m
    => Int
    -> Lens' (Producer a m x) (Producer a m (Producer a m x))
```

.zoom
Connect lenses to Parsers
```haskell
zoom
    :: Lens' (Producer a m x) (Producer b m y)
    -> Parser b m r
    -> Parser a m r
```

`Iso'`: don't provide them if there is error messages involved in encoding and decoding. Stick to `Lens'`


## Pipes-Group

FreeT nests each subsequent Producer within the return value of the previous Producer so that you cannot access the next Producer until you completely drain the current Producer.

split / transform / join paradigm

```haskell
-- A "splitter" such as `groupBy`, `chunksOf` or `splitOn`
Producer a m ()           -> FreeT (Producer a m) m ()  ~   [a]  -> [[a]]

-- A "transformation" such as `takeFree`
FreeT (Producer a m) m () -> FreeT (Producer a m) m ()  ~  [[a]] -> [[a]]

-- A "joiner" such as `concat` or `intercalate`
FreeT (Producer a m) m () -> Producer a m ()            ~  [[a]] ->  [a]
```


## Errors management

.Empty Bytestring
[WARNING]
====
If you want to transform a Producer of ByteString into another Producer, for instance of csv records, be careful to be immune of empty bytestring chunks.
Indeed `pipes-bytestring` operations don't guarantee that they won't drop empty bytestring chunks or create new ones.
```
-- first take the next elem of the source
x <- lift (next source)
        case x of
            Left () -> feedParser (k B.empty) (return ())
            Right (bs, source') ->
                if (B.null bs)
                then continue k source'
                else feedParser (k bs) source'
```
====

### Managed

You have a resource a that can be acquired and then released.
```haskell bb
-- | A @(Managed a)@ is a resource @(a)@ bracketed by acquisition and release
newtype Managed a = Manage
    { -- | Consume a managed resource
      with :: forall x . (a -> IO x) -> IO x
    }
Resource ((forall b. IO b -> IO b) -> IO (Allocated a))
```

##  Arrows and push based pipe

Events are discrete <- PUSH based. +
Behaviors are continuous <- PULL based

`ArrowChoice` corresponds to concurrency and `Arrow` corresponds to parallelism

## Controller/Model/View

.Controller
Represent concurrent effectful inputs to your system. A `controller` is really just a synonym for an `Input` from `pipes-concurrency`. So you have this function:
```
producer :: Buffer a -> Producer a IO () -> Managed (Controller a)
```

.Model
A pure streaming transformation from the combined controller to the combined views.
You can test this pure kernel by swapping out controllers with predicable inputs.
```
asPipe :: Pipe a b (State s) () -> Model s a b
```

.View
Handles all effectful outputs from the model.
```
asSink :: (a -> IO ()) -> View aa
```

.Run it
```haskell
runMVC ::
  initialState
  -> Model s a b
  -> Managed (View b, Controller a)
  -> IO s
```

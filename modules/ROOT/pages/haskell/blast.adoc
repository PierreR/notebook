# Blast

Two main ideas:

- build two 'isomorphic' AST for the slave and the master. The nodes (shape) is the same but each node is slighlty different in the master and slaves

- find a way so that the execution of `f x` can be done in a typed safed way on the slaves using the cache

- you know from the start how many slaves you have

Kubernetes::
Chaque pod dans Kubernetes possÃ¨de une adresse IP unique -> One slave == one pod

One slave is failing, you get another one inside the pod -> same IP

# Infra

## Cloud

VPC:: Virtual Private Cloud

## VMWare

ESXi:: hypervisor

## Network

VLAN:: Level 2 segmentation of a network
In a more general sense, VLAN provides logical segmentations of networks.

Subnet:: Level 3 segmentation of a network


## Storage

IBM SVC::
SAN Volume Controler.

IBM Easy Tier::
Functionality included in IBM `Storwize` to automatically migrate high demand storage data (Hot) to SSD (and vice-versa).

NAS::
Network Attached Storage.

SAN::
Storage Area Network - not ideal for containers.

iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface)::
TCP / IP-based protocol used to manage interconnections between IP storage devices (in SANs).

LUN (Logical Unit Number):: represents the actual disk


Object storage::
Object storage adds comprehensive metadata to the file, eliminating the tiered file structure used in file storage, and places everything into a flat address space.

Block storage::
..

RAID 10::
RAID 10 is a combination of levels 1 (mirroring) and 0 (striping).
It requires at least 4 different disks.
+
RAID 10 protects you from a single drive failure.
The mirror takes over for a time while you replace the failed disk and rebuild the copy.

At the CIRB, the VMWare (SVC) and GlusterFS storage are totally separated. GlusterFS is backed up by Redhad physical appliance.

## HyperConverged

Fuse compute, network, storage and virtualization within a big system or even backup (see HPE Simplivity)


## ACI

Network microsegmentation (by Cisco)
ACI stands for "Application Centric Interface".

### EPG

3 kinds of EPG:

 - EPG segmentation
 - Intra EPG Isolation
 - ÂµE Attribute based EPG (will point to the same BD)

### VRF

# Storage

IBM SVC::
SAN Volume Controler.

IBM Easy Tier::
Functionality included in IBM `Storwize` to automatically migrate high demand storage data (Hot) to SSD (and vice-versa).

NAS::
A file-level Network Attached Storage.

SAN::
Storage Area Network - not ideal for containers.

iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface)::
iSCSI and Fibre Channel (FC) are both leading methods of transmitting data to remote storage (SAN/NAS)
iSCSI is an TCP/IP based protocol.
It is less expensive and simpler to deploy and manage, but has higher latency compared to FC.

LUN (Logical Unit Number):: represents the actual disk

Object storage::
Object storage adds comprehensive metadata to the file, eliminating the tiered file structure used in file storage, and places everything into a flat address space.

Block storage::
..

RAID 10::
RAID 10 is a combination of levels 1 (mirroring) and 0 (striping).
It requires at least 4 different disks.
+
RAID 10 protects you from a single drive failure.
The mirror takes over for a time while you replace the failed disk and rebuild the copy.

At the CIRB, the VMWare (SVC) and GlusterFS storage are totally separated. GlusterFS is backed up by Redhad physical appliance.

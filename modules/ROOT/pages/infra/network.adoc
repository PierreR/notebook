## ACI

ACI stands for Application Centric Interface, a network microsegmentation system by Cisco.

### Tenant

A configuration space with some access defined. Can be related to VDCs (Virtual Device Context)

### Virtual routing and forwarding (VRF)

### Bridge domain (BD)

Subnet, L2 or L3 ~> primary VLAN

### Endpoint Group (EPG)

a security zone/group ~ (secondary) VLAN

ACI allows to have multiple EPGs (VLANs) built on the same BD (Subnet).

3 kinds of EPG:

- EPG segmentation
- Intra EPG Isolation
- ÂµE Attribute based EPG (will point to the same BD)


### Application Profile (AP)

Group of EPGs, EPGs that can be spread across different BD.
